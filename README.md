Group Project for UCSD Data Science Bootcamp


database used to aggregate data??
	call to it to look at that data
	clean in pandas, upload to database, then aggregate and pull out of database

alberto analyzing machine learning
brian working with R and did some spreadsheet analysys
scott doing spreadsheet analysis and working through pandas and Tableau


recap july 5th:
we're in agreement to use the two datasets available. We're splitting up into analyzing trends or making predictions based on what topics we want to use.

Scott - Github repo owner/ Tableua, Brian - Rstudio, Alberto - Machine Learning.

Not sure what you want to work on, Jadon. Ryan recommended we start writing some notes on what we did each meeting so its easier to trace back our steps if need be.




recap July 7, 2022:   
Jadon will be working with cleaning up dataset & working with javascript. Alberto will drop unsupervised ML and start focusing on simple linear regression supervised ML. Scott will continue making visual graphs through Tableau.  Brian will focus on doing statistical analysis on the datasets including heat maps.
Jadon & Alberto will be collaborating to ensure datasets look collaborative for both users.

comparison - state to state trends tableau / trend data



machine learning - linear regression for predicting prices in each state

tableau - heatmap of how many people leaving per state (dark red leaving - green positive) - animation per year

net change - per state - not just adds

where correlation happens - only use data that overlaps


Recap July 12th, 2022
Scott moving from Tableau to helping with Database creation. Also spent time with Github merging with help of TA’s.
Alberto has finished his machine learning. Has also made AWS database..
Brian is finalizing visuals from Rstudio, and moving on to helping Jadon with HTML.
Jadon is working on the website itself.
Everyone submit their portion of what they’ve done, and what conclusions they’ve made from their work for Jadon to upload for his HTML website. Also send their visuals/graphs for Jadon to upload onto the website. Mark which ones to upload..


Recap July 19th, 2022
Alberto will start focusing on other types of machine learning, potentially using unsupervised ML using Brian's correlation matrices as guidance.
Brian will start focusing on Flask app & Heroku. Potentially use Javascript (Low priority)
Jadon will start updating the webpage
Scott will working with Alberto's pgAdmin work
General:
we are in agreement to have updated Readme's on our own branches.
We will organize our branches to make the final merge to main branch smooth as possible.
Need to update the tabs on our website instead of using 'R', "Machine Learning", etc...
