database used to aggregate data??
	call to it to look at that data
	clean in pandas, upload to database, then aggregate and pull out of database

alberto analyzing machine learning
brian working with R and did some spreadsheet analysys
scott doing spreadsheet analysis and working through pandas and Tableau


recap july 5th:
we're in agreement to use the two datasets available. We're splitting up into analyzing trends or making predictions based on what topics we want to use.

Scott - Github repo owner/ Tableua, Brian - Rstudio, Alberto - Machine Learning.

Not sure what you want to work on, Jadon. Ryan recommended we start writing some notes on what we did each meeting so its easier to trace back our steps if need be.




recap July 7, 2022:   
Jadon will be working with cleaning up dataset & working with javascript. Alberto will drop unsupervised ML and start focusing on simple linear regression supervised ML. Scott will continue making visual graphs through Tableau.  Brian will focus on doing statistical analysis on the datasets including heat maps.
Jadon & Alberto will be collaborating to ensure datasets look collaborative for both users.

comparison - state to state trends tableau / trend data



machine learning - linear regression for predicting prices in each state

tableau - heatmap of how many people leaving per state (dark red leaving - green positive) - animation per year

net change - per state - not just adds

where correlation happens - only use data that overlaps


Recap July 12th, 2022
Scott moving from Tableau to helping with Database creation. Also spent time with Github merging with help of TA’s.
Alberto has finished his machine learning. Has also made AWS database..
Brian is finalizing visuals from Rstudio, and moving on to helping Jadon with HTML.
Jadon is working on the website itself.
Everyone submit their portion of what they’ve done, and what conclusions they’ve made from their work for Jadon to upload for his HTML website. Also send their visuals/graphs for Jadon to upload onto the website. Mark which ones to upload..


Recap July 14th, 2022
Jadon and Alberto finishing up the merging of the two datasets.
Scott helping Alberto with the SQL database
Brian starting to work on HTML for the webpage presentation. Some further work on R performed with help of TA's.
